# Project description

The project consists of the creation of a real estate portal, connected to an api (https://api-casas.kevinmamaqi.com/api-casas)
In which different pages are created that allow the user to view the existing properties and their characteristics, allowing to filter searches, create ads, generate a profile and ad statistics.

Through the project, we will fix bugs, implement new functions and finish designing the web as in the demo (https://xd.adobe.com/view/6889eb5a-76b3-4b9d-adcb-0d76da6a8789-3dda/grid)
